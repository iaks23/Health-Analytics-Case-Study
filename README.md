# ðŸš¨ Problem Statement <a name='problem'></a>

The General Manager of Analytics at Health Co has requested our assistance with their analysis of the health.user_logs dataset. The Health Co analytics team have shared with us their SQL script - they unfortunately ran into a few bugs that they couldnâ€™t fix! 

Our task here is to debug their SQL script, and retrieve all the correct answers to the business questions the GM has requested for a board meeting about their active users.

# ðŸ“– Business Questions <a name='questions'></a>

### These were the questions that the GM needed us to fetch from our queries.

 Q1. How many *unique users* exist in the logs dataset?
 
 Q2. How many total measurements do we have *per user on average*?
 
 Q3. What about the *median* number of measurements per user?
 
 Q4. How many *users* have 3 or more *measurements*?
 
 Q5. How many *users* have *1,000 or more measurements*?

> Looking at the logs data - what is the number and *percentage of the active user* base who:

 Q6. Have logged *blood glucose measurements*?
 
 Q7. Have at least 2 types of measurements?
 
 Q8. Have all *3 measures* - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?

> For users that have blood pressure measurements:

 Q9. What is the *median systolic/diastolic blood pressure* values?



# ðŸŒŸ Solutions <a name='solutions'></a>

### Q1: How many *unique users* exist in the logs dataset?

```sql

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS unique_users FROM health.user_logs;

```
|unique_users|
|---|
|554|

### Q2: How many total measurements do we have *per user on average*?

```sql

SELECT ROUND(AVG(measure_count),2) AS Avg_Measurements
FROM user_measure_count;

```
|Avg_Measurements|
|---|
|79.23|


### Q3: What about the *median* number of measurements per user?

```sql

SELECT
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY measure_count) AS median_value
FROM user_measure_count;

```
|Median_Value|
|---|
|2|


### Q4: How many *users* have 3 or more *measurements*?

```sql

SELECT COUNT(id) AS no_of_users
FROM user_measure_count 
WHERE measure_count >= 3;

```
|no_of_users|
|---|
|209|

### Q5: How many *users* have 1000 or more *measurements*?

```sql

SELECT COUNT(id) AS no_of_users
FROM user_measure_count 
WHERE measure_count >= 1000;

```
|no_of_users|
|---|
|5|

### Q6: Have logged *blood glucose measurements*?

```sql

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT id) as no_of_users
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure='blood_glucose';

```
|no_of_users|
|---|
|325|

### Q7: Have at least 2 types of measurements?

```sql

SELECT COUNT(id) as no_of_users
FROM user_measure_count
WHERE unique_measures >= 2;

```
|no_of_users|
|---|
|204|

### Q8: Have all *3 measures* - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?

```sql

SELECT COUNT(id)
FROM user_measure_count as no_of_users
WHERE unique_measures = 3;

```
|no_of_users|
|---|
|50|

### Q8: What is the *median systolic/diastolic blood pressure* values?

```sql

SELECT
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY systolic) AS median_systolic,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY diastolic) AS median_diastolic
FROM health.user_logs
WHERE measure='blood_pressure';

```
|median_systolic|median_diastolic|
|---|---|
|126|79|
