# ðŸš¨ Problem Statement <a name='problem'></a>

The General Manager of Analytics at Health Co has requested our assistance with their analysis of the health.user_logs dataset. The Health Co analytics team have shared with us their SQL script - they unfortunately ran into a few bugs that they couldnâ€™t fix! 

Our task here is to debug their SQL script, and retrieve all the correct answers to the business questions the GM has requested for a board meeting about their active users.
